        <h2>Sri Sri Radha Madan Mohan</h2>
        <h3>Sri Sri Radha Madan Mohan Temple This 60 foot high temple was opened in 1580 on a 50 foot hill called Dvadasaditya Tila, next to the Yamuna. Built by Ram Das Kapur at the request of Sanatana Goswami this was the first temple to be built in Vrindavan, which at that time was just a forest. The deity of Krishna (Madana Mohana) was discovered by Sanatana Goswami. Worshiped along with Madana Mohana are Radharani and Lalita Sakhi.</h3>
        <h3>Madanmohan means “one who can even enchant Cupid.” The Deity of Madanmohan (formerly Madan-Gopal) was made for Krisna’s great grandson Vajranabha and for many years it was lost. Advaita Acarya discovered the original Deity of Madanmohan (Krishna) in Mahavan-Gokul and served Him here at the base of an old “vat” tree. Before His departure for Navadvip He entrusted the Deity to brahmana Chaube in Mathura. Years later Caitanya Mahaprabhu sent Sanatana Goswami to Vrindavan to discover lost places of Krishna’s pastimes and write books about devotional service. Advaita Acarya used to performed his bhajana here at Advaita-vat at the base of the hill. Sanatan used to beg in nearby Mathura and one day came to doors of the brahman Chaube. He saw brahmana’s children playing with the Deity as if Madanmohan was one of them. Horrified Sanatan chastised Chaubha and taught him proper ways of Deity worship. Both Sanatan and brahman had a dream that night. Madanmohan appeared to Sanatan and told him, that he liked to be treated as one of the brahmana’s children and since Sanatan introduced so many rules, He don’t like it any more.</h3>
        <h3>To Chaube, Madanmohan said that he is like one of his children. He told him that he had many children and he should give Him to Sanatan. Next morning both devotees wanted to apologize, but at the end Madanmohan went with Sanatan. But not before, the deity promised to Sanatan that He would be satisfied with whatever he will be able to offer. Sanatan, being traveling mendicant could not give much luxury to his Deity. Sanatana was practicing madhukari (begging from doors to doors) and he could offer to the Deity just dry bread balls. Madan-Mohan asked him, if he could give Him at least little salt. Sanatan replied he would like to but being dedicated to his bhajan couldn’t afford such a “luxury”. Shortly afterwards down the Dvadasaditya Hill, the merchant’s boat went aground in the Yamuna river. The owner Krisnadas Kapoor was worried about his goods and didn’t know what to do. Madan-Mohan took the form of small cowherd boy and led him upwards to Sanatana. Merchant described what happened, but Sanatan replied he couldn’t do anything about it, being just a sannyasi. But he told him to pray to Madan-Mohan Deity he had kept just humbly roofed nearby. The merchant did what Sanatan advised and few moments later his boat was released by rising of Yamuna’s waters. Sailing down to Agra and making big profit, he later under Sanatana’s direction began to construct temple for Madan-Mohan which became one of the symbols and dominant features of Vrindavan. Worshiped along with Madan-Mohan are Radharani and Lalita. They were sent to Vrindavan by Purusottam Sen, a disciple of Maharaja Prapatarudra. The original Madan-Mohan Deity was moved from Vrindavan to Jaipur when the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb’s soldiers attacked Vrindavan in 1670. That Deity is now in Karoli, which is southeast of Jaipur in Rajasthan.</h3>
