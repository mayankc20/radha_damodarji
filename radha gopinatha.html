       <h2>Radha-Gopinath, original deities (Jaipur)</h2>
       <h3>  Sri Krishna´s grandson Vajranabha had three Deities carved according the descriptions of Krishna given by Parikshit´s mother Uttara. Thousands of years later, the same deity of Gopinath was rediscovered at Vamsi Vat in Vrindavan by Gadadhar Pandit´s disciple Paramananda Bhattacharya. Later the seva was taken over by Sri Madhu Pandit, whose samadhi is located at back of the temple premises.</h3>
       <h3>In the hall leading to Radha-Gopinath´s current altar there is a doorway on the right leading down a step into a small temple room. This is the old temple where the original Deities of Radha-Gopinath lived before the Mughal invasion when they were moved to Jaipur. Now the deity being worshipped here is ¨Muralidhar Mahaprabhu, a form of Goursundar playing the flute”. The temple Gosvami says of the deity, ¨This deity was installed after the Mughal invasion. Mahaprabhu holds the flute, for the sake of the general populace who don’t know about Mahaprabhu´s svarup. His color is golden like Radharani, but he holds the flute to show that he is also Krishna; He is Radha and Krishna in one form.¨s</h3>
