       <h2>Sri Sri Radha Gokulananda:</h2>
       <h3>In this temple there is the small Radha-Vinoda Deities of Lokanatha Gosvami, the larger Deities of Vijaya Govinda of Baladeva Vidyabhusana and the Radha Gokulananda Deities of Viswanath Cakravarti. The small Deity of Krishna in front of Gokulananda and the Deity of Caitanya Mahaprabhu were worshiped by Narottama Dasa Thakur. Viswanath Cakravarti arranged to have this temple built. Formerly, all the Deities in this temple were worshiped alone in their own temples.</h3>
       <h3>Originally, Viswanath Cakravarti worshiped the Deity of Gokulananda at Radha Kunda. He then moved to Radha Gokulananda, Vrindavana and stayed with Lokanatha Gosvami, where Lokanatha Gosvami would do his bhajana. When the original temple of Radha-Vinoda fell apart, Viswanath Cakravarti had another temple built and called it the Gokulananda temple. Both his Deity of Gokulananda and Radha-Vinoda were worshiped here.</h3>

      <h2>Govardhan Shila of Raghunath Dasa Goswami given by Lord Chaitanya:</h2>
      <h3>There is a Govardhana-shila in this temple that was given by Lord Chaitanya to Raghunath Dasa Gosvami. This shila bears the thumb print of Lord Caitanya. He used to chant while holding the shila, pressing it to His heart or eyes. The shila was always moist with Lord Caitanyaâ€™s tears. He would place it on His head or smell it. Lord Chaitanya kept this shila for three years and then gave it to Raghunatha dasa. This shila can be seen if you give a small donation. Krishna Priya Thakurani, the daughter of Ganganarayan Chakravarti , the disciple of Narottama dasa, got the service of worshiping Giridhara, the Govardhana shila of Raghunatha dasa Gosvami.</h3>
